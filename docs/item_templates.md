# Item Templates by Family

Each family uses repeatable, single-sentence templates with clear True/False answers. Keep numbers as digits and language simple.

## Arithmetic Comparisons
- **Template:** "A + B is greater than/less than/equal to C." or "If X items cost Y each, Z items cost W." 
- **True example:** "5 + 7 is greater than 10." (True)
- **False example:** "If a box has 3 apples and 2 more are added, the box has 8 apples." (False)

## Number Properties
- **Template:** "N is even/odd/prime/multiple of M." or "N is divisible by M." 
- **True example:** "18 is a multiple of 6." (True)
- **False example:** "21 is an even number." (False)

## Lists and Patterns
- **Template:** "In the pattern a, b, c, the next number/letter is d." or "The sequence increases by X each time." 
- **True example:** "In the list 2, 4, 6, the next number is 8." (True)
- **False example:** "If the pattern adds 3 each time, the sequence 1, 4, 7 next gives 11." (False)

## Transitive Comparisons
- **Template:** "If A is taller/heavier/older than B, and B is taller/heavier/older than C, then A is taller/heavier/older than C." 
- **True example:** "If A is faster than B and B is faster than C, then A is faster than C." (True)
- **False example:** "If X is older than Y and Y is older than Z, then Z is older than X." (False)

## Set / Category Logic
- **Template:** "All/Some/No X are Y; Z is an X; therefore Z is/is not Y." 
- **True example:** "All robots are metal; Rix is a robot; Rix is metal." (True)
- **False example:** "Some birds are red; Kio is a bird; Kio must be red." (False)

## Ordering / Spatial Reasoning
- **Template:** "A is before/after B in a line; C is before/after A; therefore order is ..." or "Object positions left/right/first/last." 
- **True example:** "If A stands before B and B stands before C, then A is before C." (True)
- **False example:** "If P is left of Q and Q is left of R, then R is left of P." (False)

## Points and Scoring Problems
- **Template:** "If each X is worth p points and each Y is worth q points, then combination totals r points." 
- **True example:** "If a star is 3 points and a circle is 2 points, two stars and one circle are 8 points." (True)
- **False example:** "If a win is 5 points and a tie is 2 points, two wins and one tie give 15 points." (False)

## Basic Logical Rules (If/Then/All/Some)
- **Template:** "If X happens, then Y happens" or "If X and Y, then Z." Use clear binary conditions. 
- **True example:** "If it rains, the ground gets wet; it rains; the ground gets wet." (True)
- **False example:** "If all cubes are blue, then some cubes are not blue." (False)
