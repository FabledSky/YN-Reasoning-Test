# Language Guidelines

These rules capture the grammar, vocabulary, and single-sentence expectations described in the project README for writing Yes/No reasoning items.

## Grammar and Sentence Form
- Write exactly **one sentence per item**; avoid multi-sentence prompts.
- Use **simple present tense** and straightforward clause order; keep conditionals clear ("If X, then Y").
- Avoid double negatives, stacked clauses, or heavy punctuation; commas should be minimal and purposeful.
- Keep sentences declarative; end with a single period unless a question mark is required by phrasing.

## Vocabulary and Tone
- Use **simple, professional English** aimed at A2–B1 ESL readers.
- Prefer **short, common words**; avoid idioms, slang, and academic connectors like "therefore" or "consequently."
- Use **digits for numbers** (e.g., `5`, `12`) rather than spelled-out numerals.
- Choose **generic nouns** (letters, simple names, basic objects) instead of culture-specific references or trivia.

## Single-Sentence Constraint
- Each item must be a **single sentence** even when it contains an embedded rule (e.g., points, conditions, comparisons).
- Do not split instructions into multiple sentences or add bullet lists inside an item.
- Keep items concise enough for easy ESL comprehension; aim for short length and clear structure.
